<br>

<h1 id="setup">‚öôÔ∏è Installation</h1>

To integrate Pythagora into your Node.js app, you just need to install the pythagora package
<br>
   ```bash
   npm install pythagora
   ```
And that's it - no config or setup! You are ready to start recording your integration tests!
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="capturingtests">üé• Capturing tests</h1>

Pythagora records all requests to endpoints of your app with the response and everything that's happening during the request. Currently, that means all Mongo and Redis queries with responses (in the future 3rd party API requests, disk IO operations, etc.). Then, when you run the tests, Pythagora can simulate the server conditions from the time when the request was captured.

1. <b>From the root directory</b> run Pythagora in a capture mode first to capture test data and mocks.
   <br>
      ```bash
      npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode capture
      ```
   Eg. if you start your Node.js app with `nest start` then the command would be:
   <br>
      ```bash
      npx pythagora --init-command "nest start" --mode capture
      ```
2. Click around your application or make requests to your API. Pythagora will capture all requests and responses.
   <br><br>
   <br><br>
   <b>NOTES: </b>
    - to stop the capture, you can exit the process like you usually do (Eg. `Ctrl + C`)
    - on Windows make sure to run all commands using `Git Bash` and not `Power Shell` or anything similiar

<br>
<br>
<h1 id="executingtests">‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running tests</h1>
When running tests, it doesn‚Äôt matter what database is your Node.js connected to or what is the state of that database. Actually, that database is never touched or used ‚Äî> instead, Pythagora creates a special, ephemeral pythagoraDb database, which it uses to restore the data before each test is executed, which was present at the time when the test was recorded. Because of this, tests can be run on any machine or environment.

**If a test does an update to the database, Pythagora also checks the database to see if it was updated correctly.**

So, after you captured all requests you want, you just need to change the mode parameter to `--mode test` in the Pythagora command.
<br>
   ```bash
   npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode test
   ```

<h1 id="exportjest">ü§ñ Ô∏èGenerate Jest tests with Pythagora and GPT-4</h1>

You can export any Pythagora test to Jest with GPT-4. To see how it works, you can watch [the full demo video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHbwX4QVoGY).

## What are Jest integration tests made of

- **Database setup** (before a test is run)
    - during the export to Jest, Pythagora saves all database documents in the `pythagora_tests/exported_tests/data` folder as a JSON file
    - in the `beforeEach` function, these documents are restored into the database so that the database is in the same state as it was when the test was recorded
    - Pythagora has built-in functions to work with the database but in case you want to use your own and completely separate Jest tests from Pythagora, use the `global-setup.js` file in which you can set up your own ways to populate the database, get a collection and clear the database
- **User authentication** (when the endpoint requires authentication)
    - the first time you run the export, Pythagora will create `auth.js` file
    - it is used inside `beforeEach` function to retrieve the authentication token so that API requests (that require authentication) can be executed
- **Test**
    - tests check the response from the API and if the database is updated correctly

## How to export Pythagora tests to Jest

1. First, you need to tell Pythagora what is the login endpoint. You can do that by running:

    ```bash
    npx pythagora --export-setup
    ```

2. After that, just run Pythagora capture command and log into the app so the login route gets captured.

    ```bash
    npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode capture
    ``` 

3. Exporting to Jest is done with GPT-4 so you either need to have OpenAI API key with GPT-4 access or a Pythagora API key which you can get [here](https://mailchi.mp/f4f4d7270a7a/api-waitlist). Once you have the API key, you're ready to export tests to Jest by running:

    ```bash
    npx pythagora --export --test-id <TEST_ID> --openai-api-key <YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
    ```
   or
    ```bash
    npx pythagora --export --test-id <TEST_ID> --pythagora-api-key <YOUR_PYTHAGORA_API_KEY>
    ```

4. To run the exported tests, run:

    ```bash
    npx pythagora --mode jest
    ```

Exported tests will be available in the `pythagora_tests/exported_tests` folder.

NOTE: Pythagora uses GPT-4 8k model so some tests that do too many things during the processing might exceed the 8k token limit. To check which tests you can export to Jest, you can run:

```bash
npx pythagora --tests-eligible-for-export
```

<h1 id="commands">üîé Examples</h1>
Here are examples of open sourced repositories which we forked and created tests with Pythagora so you can easily see it in action.

<br><br>
<h1 id="commands">üîß Maintenance / update of tests</h1>

Sometimes tests failing is expected behaviour if the code behaviour is updated. In those cases, tests need to be updated. Pythagora provides a git like interface where you can review
all changes that are breaking the test and easily (A)ccept them if they are expected or (D)elete the test if you think it's invalid. To start the review process, just run the Pythagora command with `--review` flag.
<br><br>
```bash
npx pythagora --review
```

You can watch the [workflow with Pythagora video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQP8NMCiPw) in which I go deeper into details of the review process.
<br><br>

<h1 id="commands">‚ùå Deleting tests</h1>

If you made some bigger changes to the repo and you want to rewrite many tests, you can delete all of them with `--delete-all-failed` flag.
<br><br>

```bash
npx pythagora --delete-all-failed
```
<br>

If you want to delete only one test using testId you can use
<b>--delete testId</b> like this:
   ```bash
   npx pythagora --delete testId
   ```
<br>

<h1 id="options">üìñ Other Options</h1>

These are available options for Pythagora command:
<br><br><br>
<b>--rerun-all-failed</b> (runs again only tests that failed in previous run)
   ```bash
   npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode test --rerun-all-failed
   ```
<br>

<b>--test-id</b> (runs test by Id)
   ```bash
   npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode test --test-id testId
   ```
<br>

<b>--pick endpoint1 endpoint2</b> (starts capturing only listed endpoints)
   ```bash
   npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode capture --pick /endpoint1 /endpoint2
   ```
<br>

<b>--ignore endpoint1 endpoint2</b> (starts capturing but ignores all listed endpoints)
   ```bash
   npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode capture --ignore /endpoint1 /endpoint2
   ```

<br><br>
<h1 id="codecoveragereport">üìù Code Coverage Report</h1>

Code coverage is a great metric while building automated tests as it shows us which lines of code are covered by the tests. Pythagora uses `nyc` to generate a report about code that was covered with Pythagora tests. By default, Pythagora will show you the basic code coverage report summary when you run tests.
<br>
<br>

If you want to generate a more detailed report, you can do so by running Pythagora with `--full-code-coverage-report` flag. Eg.
   ```bash
   npx pythagora --init-command "my start command" --mode test --full-code-coverage-report
   ```
You can find the code coverage report inside `pythagora_tests` folder in the root of your repository. You can open the HTML view of the report by opening `pythagora_tests/code_coverage_report/lcov-report/index.html`.

<br>

In case you don't want the code coverage to be shown at all while running tests, you can run the tests with `--no-code-coverage` parameter. This is helpful
during debugging process since the code coverage report can clash with your IDE's debugger.

<br><br>
<h1 id="authentication"> üîë Authentication</h1>
For authentication we support <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken" target="_blank">JWT</a>, sessions stored in
<a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> and sessions stored in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.
First 2 cases cases (JWT and sessions stored in Redis) should work just fine without
any additional implementation but for session that are stored in MongoDB you need to add this one line of code:

```javascript
if (global.Pythagora) global.Pythagora.authenticationMiddleware = true;
```
just before your authentication middleware. For example, if you are using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session" target="_blank">express-session</a>
you would have to add our line of code just above your middleware that is managing sessions in your DB, like this:

```javascript
if (global.Pythagora) global.Pythagora.authenticationMiddleware = true;

app.use(session({
    secret: 'my-secret',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
        maxAge: 60 * 60 * 1000
    },
    store: MongoStore.create({
        mongoUrl: mongourl,
        mongoOptions: {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true
        }
    })
}));
```
That's it! You are ready to go and all your API requests with authentication should PASS!

<br><br>
<h1 id="testdata">üó∫Ô∏èÔ∏è Where can I see the tests?</h1>

Each JSON file in this repository represents one endpoint that was captured and each endpoint can have many captured tests.
If you open these files, you will see an array in which each object represents a single test. All data that's needed to run a test
is stored in this object. Here is an example of a test object.

<h1 id="support">ü§îÔ∏è FAQ</h1>

- **What happens when I make intential change that breaks tests. How can I update Pythagora tests?**
    - Pythagora tests can easily be updated by running the review command (`npx pythagora --review`). The review process is basically the same as a git review where you'll find each difference between the captured test and the failed one so you can choose if you need to debug this or you want to accept the new change. If you click `a`(as "accept"), the test will automatically update.

- **Automated tests should show me where the bug is - how can I find a bug with Pythagora tests?**
    - When a test fails, you can easily rerun the test that failed by adding `--test-id <TEST_ID>` to the test command. This way, if you add breakpoints across your code, you'll be able to easily debug the test itself with all the data the test is using. Also, we have plans for adding bug tracking features but at the moment we don't know when will it be ready.
